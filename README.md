# Bayern Tourismus Hackathon 2024

3 ideas:

1. Hiking trips with data from [Bayern Tourismus Cloud](https://bayerncloud.digital/)
2. People can collect QR codes or NFC beacons at locations to receive achievements (Gamification of visiting POIs)
3. Find hotels that have lots of points of interests nearby to allow people with disabilities to find new places to visit
